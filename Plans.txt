Set up a base script that sets a seed, splits into test/training: Kai, will do in 10 minutes :)

Run Diagnostic information on data, look at what's there: Jayaty

Try a bunch of different model, report back together at the end

Try to run LOOCV, see if performance is tolerable.  Else, K=10.

-> Linear model [check for errors, non-normal error, heteroscedasticity, colinearity, etc]
  -> Simple linear model: Ekin
  -> Best subset selection: Ekin
  -> Interactions/higher powers: Zach
  -> Ridge/lasso regression: Morgan
-> PCR [can fix colinearity, probably not other things like non-normal errors, non-normal dataset]
  -> Jayaty

-> Regression tree / bagging / random forests [think these are immune to non-normal errors, heteroscedasticity, colinearity -- go check & make sure]
  -> Kai
  
  
Timeframe:
- Get models built by the 26th
- Discuss again on the 27th, review different models, decide on one or two good ones
- Spend most of that week writing
- Polish up report in last couple days
